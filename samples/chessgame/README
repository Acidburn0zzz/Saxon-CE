Saxon-CE Chess game application demo

=============================

This demo was used for the XMLPrague 2013 paper: Multi-user interaction using client-side XSLT
Authors: Michael Kay and O'Neil Delpratt



==============================

This saxon-ce application is intended to operate with twitter to communicate the chess game moves
between two remote players. This communication we achieved via a proxy server (namely Servlex with Twitter API). 
It is also possible to play the chess game application in offline mode without the need of a server.

Given that there are several solutions for the proxy server and that the twitter authentication access requires the storage of security tokens, we
have not included the server component in this sample application, but we can provide it upon request.
